SDL OpenGL 4 Basic

A small project for me to start getting into 3D graphics using OpenGL 4.3
as I work through the OpenGL 4.3 programmers guide.

Just got diffuse+specular lighting working so it's like we're back in the 90's
Also using phong shading, with blinn-phong specular highlights which can be turned on and off.


Building:
Linux:
All my dev it done using codeblocks on Arch linux. So if you have code:blocks, SDL2 and SDL2_image then you're 
good to go.

Windows:
The codeblocks project will need playing with. But you can download this zip which has code:blocks setups with SDL2, SDL2_image SDL2_ttf and boost headers.
So that should make it easier to get started.
